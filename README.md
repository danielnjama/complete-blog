# complete-blog
In this project, we have created a functional blog website, where the admin is able to add blogs and open for users to comment on the blog. See the key features
1. Admin section to manage blogs
2. Users comment functionality, admin has to approve a comment before it is published.
3. An improved blog text field, called RichTextField; here the admin can style the blog content with different text styling, add images and style the images as well
4. Search functionality- a simple search functionality has been implemented. Returns results based on a blog title.
5. Pagination- This has been implemented to avoid thousands of blog articles appearing on one page.


   Feel free to clone and improve the blog as you desire!
